ClassifyFile
============

A Bash script to classify videos and images in different directories.

## How this script works
You can use this script to split images and videos mixed in the same directory. Two directories will be created during the execution of this script in the working directory: "Images_<current-date>" and "Videos_<current-date>". After the script execution you will find your images in the first directory and your videos in the second one.
